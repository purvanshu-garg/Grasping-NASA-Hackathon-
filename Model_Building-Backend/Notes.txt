1) Go through two readings on the model
2) collect the data from all the three sources
3) refine it and make it usable
4) Now try different models you know for classification algorithm
5) Choose the best model you got 



# Notes :
Heirchally to be checked
1) 
2)(we can also try making interface where user may choose the model they want to work on and then put in the candidates) 
3) Consider where user has less than k data points


# suggested model 
1) Gradient boost algorithm (ensemble of decision trees)
